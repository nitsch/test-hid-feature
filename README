Description
-----------

This is a small demo project to test problematic sending of HID Feature
Reports on OSX using hidapi [1]. The problems were originally discovered
using the PlayStation Move Motion Controller with the PS Move API [2] on
OSX. This program is thus based mainly on PS Move API's HID-related code
and targets the Move Motion Controller only.

While sending HID Feature Reports to the Move Motion Controller via
Bluetooth works fine on Linux, this does not work at all on OSX. The only
working fallback seems to be sending via USB which is not always possible
(or desired).
